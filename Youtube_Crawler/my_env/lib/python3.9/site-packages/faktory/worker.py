        Creates a Faktory worker.

        ```
        tcp://:password@localhost:7419
        ```
        If you don't pass a faktory instance to connect to, the worker will check the `FAKTORY_URL` environment variable.
        If the environment variable is not set, then the worker will attempt to connect to Faktory on the localhost,
        without a password.

        If the URL scheme is `tcp+tls://` then the Faktory worker will establish a TLS encrypted connection to Faktory.

        You may pass a list of queues to process with the `queues` argument. If you supply no `queues`, then the worker
        will process the default queue.

        You may pass a list of labels to process with the `labels` argument. These are visible in the Faktory Web UI. If
        not supplied, it defaults to `labels=['python']`.
